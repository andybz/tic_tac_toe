# Tic Tac Toe

This is a tic tac toe game written in Ruby that allows a human player to
play against a program player. The game will only result in a win for
the program player or a draw.

To play, download the repository and run `ruby tic_tac_toe.rb` inside
the main directory. During game play you can mark tiles on the board by
entering cardinal directions `n` `s` `e` `w` `nw` `ne` `sw` `se` or `c`
for center.  The program will respond to non-valid input with a list of
available moves. At the end of a game you can choose to play again with
`y` or `n`.
